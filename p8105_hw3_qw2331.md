-   This dataset contains `1384617` observations and `15` variables.  
-   Among the variables, there are `11` integer variables and `4`
    character variables.  
-   Among all the variables, which are
    `order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department`,
    respectively, the key variables are:
    -   `order_id` represents an order identifier;  
    -   `product_id` represents a product identifier;  
    -   `user_id` represents a customer identifier;  
    -   `aisle_id` represents an aisle identifier;  
    -   `department_id` represents a department identifier.  
-   Illustrative examples of observations are showing below:

``` r
# Illustrative examples
items_day_p <- 
  instacart_df %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("yogurt", "cream", "fresh fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(n_purchase = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = order_dow, y = n_purchase, color = aisle)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, size = .5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Day of the week",
    y = "Purchased quantity",

  )

items_day_p
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_qw2331_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" />

-   The plot shows that:
    -   `Fresh furits` have the highest sales volume comparing with the
        other two;  
    -   In generally, people will shop online using Instacart on Sunday.

**Answer the following questions**  
+ How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
n_items_of_aisle <- 
  instacart_df %>% 
  count(aisle, name = "n_items") %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_items))

n_items_of_aisle

There are `134` aisles in this dataset; Most items are ordered from the
aisle `fresh vegetables`.

-   Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisle with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
n_items_of_aisle %>% 
  filter(n_items > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n_items)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n_items, y = aisle, fill = aisle)) +
  geom_bar(
    stat = "identity", 
    show_guide = FALSE
    ) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = n_items), size = 2.5, hjust = 0) + 
  labs(
    x = "Number of items ordered",
    y = "Aisle",
    title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle",
    caption = "Data from p8105 package"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_qw2331_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />

-   Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

``` r
instacart_df %>% 
  filter(
    aisle %in% 
      c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")
  ) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarize(number_items = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_items)) %>% 
  do(head(., n = 3)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Top 3 most popular items",
    align = "c"
  )
```

Top 3 most popular items

-   Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 \* 7 table)

``` r
instacart_df %>% 
  filter(
    product_name %in%
      c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")
  ) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    order_dow = weekdays(Sys.Date() + 0:6)[order_dow + 1]
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    digits = 1,
    caption = "Mean hour of a day ordered",
    align = "c")
```

## Problem 2

**Load the `BRFSS` data**

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss_df <- brfss_smart2010
```

**Do some data cleaning**

``` r
brfss_df <- 
  brfss_df %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  mutate(
    response = factor(response,
                      levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"),
                      ordered = TRUE)
  )
```

**Answer the following questions**  
+ In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
2010?

``` r
# Number of locations in 2002
loc_2002 <- 
  brfss_df %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n()/5) %>% 
  filter(n_locations >= 7) %>% 
  arrange(n_locations)

loc_2002 %>%   
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Number of locations in 2002",
    align = "l"
  )
```

| locationabbr | n\_locations |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| CT           | 7            |
| FL           | 7            |
| NC           | 7            |
| MA           | 8            |
| NJ           | 8            |
| PA           | 10           |

Number of locations in 2002

``` r
# Number of locations in 2010
loc_2010 <- 
  brfss_df %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n()/5) %>% 
  filter(n_locations >= 7) %>% 
  arrange(n_locations)

loc_2010 %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Number of locations in 2010",
    align = "l"
  )
```

| locationabbr | n\_locations |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| CO           | 7            |
| PA           | 7            |
| SC           | 7            |
| OH           | 8            |
| MA           | 9            |
| NY           | 9            |
| NE           | 10           |
| WA           | 10           |
| CA           | 12           |

| NC           | 12           |
| TX           | 16           |
| NJ           | 19           |
| FL           | 41           |

Number of locations in 2010

In 2002, there are `6` states in which 7 or more locations were
observed, including `CT, FL, NC, MA, NJ, PA`, while in 2010, `14` states
met the above conditions and they were
`CO, PA, SC, OH, MA, NY, NE, WA, CA, MD, NC, TX, NJ, FL`, respectively.

-   Construct a dataset that is limited to `Excellent` responses, and
    contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the `data_value`
    across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
    average value over time within a state.

``` r
# Construct a dataset
response_in_state <-   
  brfss_df %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# A "spaghetti" plot
response_in_state %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_value, color = locationabbr)) + 
  geom_line(
    size = .3,
    show_guide = FALSE)
```

    ## Warning: `show_guide` has been deprecated. Please use `show.legend` instead.

-   Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
    distribution of `data_value` for responses(“Poor” to “Excellent”)
    among locations in NY state.

``` r
resp <- 
    c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")

brfss_df %>% 
  filter(
    year %in% c(2006, 2010) & locationabbr == "NY" & response %in% resp) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = factor(response, levels = resp)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(year, response) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = mean_value, fill = response)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +  
  facet_grid(. ~ year) + 
  labs(
    y = "Mean data value in NY State",
    title = "Data value distribution in 2006 vs. 2010",
    caption = "Data from 08105 package"
  )
```
